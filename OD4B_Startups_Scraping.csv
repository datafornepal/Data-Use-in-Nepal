"21","Antardristi Nepal","Other Opportunities","Project","Antardristi was formed in 2003 to address the social issue of child sexual abuse in Nepal due to the alarming scarcity of service provision in this area. Antardristi remains one of a limited number of organisations working to eliminate child sexual abuse within Nepal and undertakes activities in the areas of awareness raising and prevention, child protection, psychosocial recovery and social reintegration. Undertaking this work is considerably complex. There is stigma around mental health which results in a silence around such problems and consequently increased isolation and unremitting difficulties. There also exists discrimination against young women reporting rape as blame may be placed with the victim. This hinders reporting of sexual abuse and violence and allowing it to continue. Moreover, the hidden nature of these difficulties can make securing funding for intervention a challenge.

Through our activities we aim to ensure access to education about sexual violence, human rights and legislation. This empowers children and women to identify, refuse and report sexually inappropriate behaviour. We also address the mental health of children and women, educating about the signs of mental distress relating to sexual abuse and about support available. We aim to challenge traditional perceptions and break down social stigma relating to both mental health and reporting of sexual abuse through our awareness workshops, family and community work. Furthermore we support women who experience sexual abuse in the development of life skills, educational inclusion and job skills training so that they can go on to live full and meaningful lives and we support children and young women who are suffering mental distress through counselling and outreach.","

"63","Community Homestay Network","Other Opportunities","Launched","Community Homestay Network is a community-based Homestay network that connects global-travelers with the real faces of Nepal for a genuine local travel experience in Nepal.

As once a French novelist Marcel Proust said, “The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.” CommunityHomestay.com is a way of exploring the rich diversity of Nepalese communities and forms a bridge to connect local people and the culture of Nepal to the rest of the world.

In our Community Homestays, the host family welcomes you as much more than just a tourist, but as a guest and a friend. During your stay with the host family, there will be many ways where you can involve yourself in their daily lives, and to participate in their local festivals, celebrations, and daily work. It is an exceptional opportunity to experience a completely different way of life, far from the mad rush of the world we are all too familiar with. Certainly, there couldn't be any better way than this to give you an insight into the real or authentic Nepal.  

In particular, CommunityHomestay.com works to encourage women’s empowerment and help preserve and value their traditional skills. Most of the owners of the Homestays are women and housewives. One of the major fundamental objectives of CommunityHomestay.com is to inspire local and indigenous communities to interact with the rest of the world through the medium of tourism. To be precise, CommunityHomestay.com is a platform for the women and local communities of Nepal to generate sustainable economic opportunities as a part of responsible tourism. 

CommunityHomestay.com is also a great way to exchange your ideas and skills to the local communities. Many of our Homestays support their own village schools and learning centers from the surplus they generate from the Homestay project. Whilst staying in one of the Homestays, you can also volunteer to teach in one of the schools, assist with the rebuilding of classrooms damaged in the earthquake, or help by simply sharing your ideas about health, education, and hygiene in the local community, encouraging and inspiring local people for better tomorrows.

Learn to cook like a local from the host family, explore the community life with them, learn native skills and see their perspective on life, inspire, get inspired, and make your vacation memorable.","

"133","HoneyGuide Apps","Funding","Public Beta","Travel and Tech is hot!! With the death of the guidebook, the pieces have been taken over by bunch of online portals on the logistical side of things. Think Tripadvisor, Agoda, Orbitz and their likes. While the ticketing and booking side has been beaten to death over and over again, it surprised us that nobody had tried to augment the travel experience itself. And as we ourselves are avid travelers, we decided to solve that problem for ourselves. While traveling, everybody wants to connect with the land and people. You want to know what bird that was and what flower that is. You also want to truly understand why people live in a certain way in that place. In short, travelers wish to become instant experts. And that is exactly what our products allow. One download and there you go, you become an expert.
While guidebooks tried to cover a large geographical area in as skimpy way as possible, we give depth. We aren’t looking for a big hit, we are looking for a niche. As any savvy marketer will tell you, the trick to a successful business now is not to sell a lot of a few things, but little of a lot of different things. And that is exactly what we intend to do. Why not make a travel app for Kathmandu and Pokhara first? We think that is as bad for business as it is boring. As such we do not make travel apps, we make trekking apps. And in the future we will make sightseeing apps, cycling apps and safari apps.


Talking of trekking apps, sightseeing apps and cycling apps, we understand that the new traveler wants technology to bend around her needs. That is why we will ensure that the core technology for all these different kinds of apps will be totally different. Oh and one more thing, we love content, but what really floats our boat is context. We believe all information should be presented in a context-sensitive manner so that people can quickly find what they are looking for. Why tell a trekker about rhododendrons in October when there are no rhododendrons around? Sure content is king, but context is the kingmaker. (Check out our Placecards in our Trekking in Nepal app to understand what we are talking about.) In short, we give the travelers exactly what she needs, when she needs it and where she needs it and how she needs it!!


But if you ask us, everything above is an after the fact generalizations so we sound professional and as though we ‘get it’. However, the fact is nobody knows what travel and tech is going to be like 5 years from now. It is a bet and the only reason we think we will win is because we are travelers ourselves (being voracious readers also helps), and we believe we understand a thing or two about travelers. And the real reason why we run our company is because we love to travel and we would love to share our love of travel with the world. We want to help you get off that chair and into the mountains. Go explore!!","

I mean Picasso had a saying he said good artists copy great artists steal. And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.""

Unlike other operators, every Kailash trekking tour is designed to expose a different characteristic of this beautiful part of the world – from the breath-taking Mount Everest to the cultural adventures you can experience on trips such as to the pristine glaciers.

Our Trekking Tour Packages
We have structured several packages designed to offer the exact experience and emotions you want. Whether you are on a search for true solitude in the birthplace of Buddha, or an adventure to the world’s highest point, we have a package for you. 
From comfortable lodges to camping the true sense of the world, our friendly local guides will educate and entice you by sharing their unique culture and hospitality.
And you are not only limited to a single route. You can trek the range, visit local lakes, take on Mt Everest itself, visit Tibet, or set your path visiting tea houses to create an unforgettable journey.

Helping Nepal: Trekking Packages and The Community
Since the devastating earthquake of April 25, 2015, the local community has prayed for the safety of trekkers as they rebuild their lives and their economy.
Those prayers have been answered, and the major trekking routes along the Langtang Valley have been opened.
This means that the community can slowly start to grow again, but only with the help of investments from tourism. As a proud local trekking operator in Nepal, we support local people with jobs and encourage guests to visit us and do the same. This is why we strongly request to hire Nepal trekking guide or at least a porter. It makes big difference to having a trekking guide or porter during your trekking trip because of our top concern is your safety and to provide as much as information about the country during your short trip of the lifetime.

Say “Namaste” to Nepal
We are ready to welcome you to our world through a trekking tour you will never forget, and Nepal is looking forward to you.","

"274","SUKHI-GHAR","Funding","Pvt. Beta","“To evolve is to sustain”. With this simple philosophy, Sukhi Ghar was established in 2018 with an aim to provide a platform for ordering home service, to public and creating a pool of employment opportunities to the skilled manpower within the country.
There is a huge gap between the skilled manpower, who do not have work to do, and the people who need appropriate service providers but don’t know whom to call for. The main aim of Sukhi Ghar is to remove this gap between the service providers and the one who need it. We plan to list the services in our platform and let the users (both the service providers and clients) choose which service they need or could provide. With the use of Sukhi Ghar platform, user can select the field of service they need and order it online, and the relevant service provider will reach their door steps, in time and within their budget.
Similarly, due to unmanaged home service industry in Nepal, the amount of money one pay for particular service differs from person to person and even the worst part is that service provider does not appear in time. Our main motto in long run is to include all fields of services that people seek during their day to day life and provide the service in their time and within their budget.
